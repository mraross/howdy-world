|Spatial Agent Man|Secret Agent Man|
|:---:|:---:|
There's a man who makes crown maps in Smithers | There's a man who leads a life of danger
Tracing mountain slopes gives him the jitters  |To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every map he makes |With every move he makes
He notices mistakes|Another chance he takes
Odds are he won't sleep until tomorrow|Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
Spatial agent man | Secret agent man
Spatial agent man | Secret agent man
They've given you a toy drone|They've given you a number
And taken away your plane|And taken away your name
=======|======
Beware of pretty places that you find|Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty place can hide an evil mine|A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Don't let the wrong name slip|Oh no, you let the wrong word slip
Through your royal grip| While kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't sleep until tomorrow|Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
=======|======
Dronin' up the Sunshine Coast on one day|Swingin' on the Riviera one day
Drivin' LIDAR down the One the next day|And then layin' in the Bombay alley next day
Every single week| Ah, be careful what you say
He maps another creek|Or you'll give yourself away
Odds are he won't sleep until tomorrow|Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
